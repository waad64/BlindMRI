Okay, here's the analysis in a `README.md` style, ready for copy-pasting:

# Analysis of PDB Values Dataset

This repository contains an analysis of a dataset comprising "Peak Decibel Level (PDB)" values. The analysis covers descriptive statistics, distribution characteristics, normality testing, and outlier detection.

## 1\. Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of `6776` individual PDB measurements.

### Basic Statistics:

| Statistic           | Value       |
| :------------------ | :---------- |
| **Count** | `6776.00`   |
| **Mean** | `71.99`     |
| **Standard Deviation** | `14.42`     |
| **Minimum** | `50.00`     |
| **25th Percentile (Q1)** | `59.39`     |
| **50th Percentile (Median)** | `70.63`     |
| **75th Percentile (Q3)** | `84.11`     |
| **Maximum** | `99.99`     |

The PDB values range from approximately 50 dB to 100 dB. The mean value is around 72 dB, with a standard deviation of 14.42 dB, indicating a moderate spread. The median (70.63 dB) is slightly less than the mean, which can sometimes suggest a slight positive skew (tail towards higher values), but further visual inspection of the distribution is crucial.

## 2\. Distribution Analysis

### 2.1. Histogram and Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)

*Figure 1* illustrates the frequency distribution of PDB values along with its Kernel Density Estimate (KDE). The distribution is clearly **multi-modal**, displaying several distinct peaks and valleys. This indicates that the PDB values do not follow a simple, unimodal distribution like a normal or uniform distribution. The presence of multiple modes suggests underlying complexities or distinct groups within the data.

### 2.2. Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plot vs Normal Distribution

*Figure 3* presents a Q-Q plot comparing the empirical quantiles of the PDB values against the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution. The significant deviation of the blue data points from the red straight line (which represents a perfect normal distribution) particularly at both tails, strongly suggests that the PDB values are **not normally distributed**.

## 3\. Statistical Tests for Distribution

### 3.1. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test Against Uniform(50,100)

  * **Statistic:** `0.1008`
  * **P-value:** `0.0000`

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to assess if the PDB values are uniformly distributed between 50 and 100 dB. The extremely low p-value (`0.0000`) leads to a **strong rejection of the null hypothesis** that the data is uniformly distributed. This is consistent with the visual evidence from the histogram.

### 3.2. Anderson-Darling Test for Normality

  * **Test Statistic:** `95.3630`

Critical values for various significance levels:

  * `15.0%` critical value: `0.5760`  -\> **Reject normality**
  * `10.0%` critical value: `0.6560`  -\> **Reject normality**
  * `5.0%` critical value: `0.7870`   -\> **Reject normality**
  * `2.5%` critical value: `0.9170`   -\> **Reject normality**
  * `1.0%` critical value: `1.0910`   -\> **Reject normality**

The Anderson-Darling test statistic (`95.3630`) is substantially larger than all critical values across different significance levels. This provides **overwhelming evidence to reject the null hypothesis of normality**. The PDB values are definitively not normally distributed.

## 4\. Outlier Detection

### 4.1. Boxplots and IQR Method

*Figure 2* and *Figure 4* display boxplots of the PDB values. The Interquartile Range (IQR) method was employed to identify potential outliers.

  * **Detected Outliers:** `0`
  * **Outlier Values (first 10, if any):** `Series([], Name: PDB, dtype: float64)`

Based on the IQR method, **no outliers were detected** in the dataset. This suggests that despite the non-normal and multi-modal nature of the distribution, there are no individual data points that are extreme enough to be flagged as outliers by this statistical criterion. The whiskers of the boxplot extend to the minimum and maximum values of the dataset (50 dB and \~100 dB respectively), reinforcing the absence of IQR-defined outliers.
